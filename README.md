# CvzoneGestureQuiz

This project is a Computer Vision Quiz application that uses hand gesture recognition to answer questions, built with the `cvzone` library. Leveraging hand tracking technology, users can interact with quiz questions by making specific gestures, creating a touch-free and engaging quiz experience. This innovative approach makes learning more interactive by combining computer vision and intuitive gesture-based controls.
